# UIUC MCS CS416 Narrative Visualization Project

Check out https://teeeskay.github.io/ for a short and simple narrative visualization on data primarily from the World Happiness Report (2024), in conjuction with scores from the Human Development Index (HDI) and Subregion categorization (UN Geoscheme) for 143 countries. 

The visualization is developed using D3.js and follows a "martini glass" narrative visualization structure, with "slides" of annotated charts and narrative texts, followed by user exploration of data at the end.
